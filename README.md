## Executive Summary
AllFoodIsFood is an online marketplace that aims to tackle the problem of food waste by connecting food distributors / supermarkets with consumers who are interested in purchasing products that would otherwise be thrown away. The platform provides a solution for the issue of "ugly food" or food that is deemed unsellable due to its physical appearance, but is still perfectly good to eat.

The platform is designed to benefit food distributors / supermarkets who struggle with food waste, as well as consumers who are interested in purchasing food products and ingredients at a lower cost. AllFoodIsFood allows distributors to create listings for their unsellable food, which consumers can purchase directly from the platform. The app provides a streamlined process for both parties, facilitating secure transactions and logistics.

AllFoodIsFood aims to reduce the amount of food waste that occurs in the food industry. It is estimated that around one-third of all food produced globally is wasted which amounts to about 1.3 billion tons annually (World Food Programme, 2020). This contributes to significant adverse environmental and economic impacts. By connecting distributors with consumers, AllFoodIsFood provides an alternative outlet for unsellable food, reducing the amount of food that ends up in landfills and reducing the environmental impact of food waste.

The platform also promotes the circular economy by reducing waste, increasing resource efficiency, and creating economic opportunities. By allowing distributors to recoup some of the costs associated with unsellable food, AllFoodIsFood helps them to become more profitable and sustainable, creating a win-win situation for both distributors and consumers.

Overall, AllFoodIsFood is a innovative solution that addresses a significant problem in the food industry. By connecting distributors with consumers, it provides an alternative outlet for unsellable food and promotes a more sustainable and efficient food system.

## Problem Statement
Did you know that one-third of food produced for human consumption is lost or wasted globally? Many supermarkets and distributors are unable to sell “ugly food” as customers tend to find it unappealing. The term “ugly food” refers to food items that do not meet market standards in terms of appearance but are otherwise good for consumption. This results in food being wasted as the supermarkets are forced to dispose of the food that they are unable to sell. Supermarkets also have to go through the hassle and incur additional costs to throw away such food which will expire if not sold. Our application aims to target this problem by allowing supermarkets to sell their “ugly food” to potential buyers to reduce wastage of such food.

## Purpose
We want to create a web application that reduces food wastage by encouraging consumption of ugly foods. At the same time, supermarkets are able to increase revenue and profits as they are able to access a wider market, and sell produce that would otherwise be wasted. The main benefits of our application are as described: 

- Reduce food wastage
- Allow buyers to purchase more affordable food items
- Allow supermarkets to increase revenue of “ugly food”
- Reduce hassle and cost of supermarkets in disposing “ugly food”
